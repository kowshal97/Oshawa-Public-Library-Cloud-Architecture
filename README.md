## üìå Overview
The project delivers a **microservice-based cloud environment** for OPL with strong emphasis on:
- High Availability  
- Security  
- Scalability  
- Backup & Disaster Recovery  
- Monitoring & Logging  

---

## üîπ Project Scope
- **Network Infrastructure**
  - Custom VPC (10.0.0.0/16)  
  - 2 Public Subnets (with Internet Gateway, NAT Gateways)  
  - 2 Private Subnets (backend + RDS)  
  - Separate route tables  

- **Compute**
  - Amazon ECS (Fargate) for containerized frontend & backend microservices  
  - Frontend in **public subnets**, Backend in **private subnets**  

- **Storage**
  - Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL (Multi-AZ, PITR enabled)  
  - Amazon S3 for media with versioning + lifecycle policy  

- **Security**
  - Security Groups (ALB, ECS, RDS isolation)  
  - IAM Roles (least privilege: S3:GetObject, PutObject, RDS connect)  
  - Encryption at rest & transit (AES-256)  

- **Scalability**
  - Auto Scaling Groups for ECS (min 2, max 4, 75% CPU threshold)  

- **Monitoring & Logging**
  - Amazon CloudWatch metrics, alarms, log collection  
  - ECS scaling triggers + RDS monitoring  

- **Backup & Recovery**
  - RDS backups with Point-in-Time Recovery (7 days)  
  - S3 versioning for object recovery
